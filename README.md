# Microcontroller-Connected
A series of projects (quests) that display interfacing of multiple sensors to send data through the help of an ESP32 microcontroller. The sensor data is sent over UDP sockets to node server that then displays the data for many of the projects in a local HTML file. Quest 3 makes use of DDNS.
