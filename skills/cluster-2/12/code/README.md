# adc1_example_main.c

Combined i2c display code with adc example code from peripherals

lowered resolution of width from 12 bits to 11 bits
  - just experimenting to get voltage value to show up

increased ADC attenuation perimeter to 12 to include the range of millivolts that would fit our target

used old alphanumeric table from last quest to display the voltage in volts
