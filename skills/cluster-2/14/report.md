## Summary
We are using an ultrasonic sensor that outputs a certain amount of analog voltage based on how close the nearest object that its facing is. If the object is close, it outputs a lower voltage and vice versa for further objects. We used the sensors data sheet to convert those voltage values to inches and then used inches to meters calculation to output the distance to the nearest object in meters to the console. We provide the Ultrasonic sensor with a 3.3 volt vcc in.
