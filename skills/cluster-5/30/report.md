## Summary
Powered up the buggy crawler. Calibration requires going to neutral and then staying there. Demo shows car steering right then left. The starts accelerating backwards fast and slows the speed down to neutral then speeds up forward. The top of the while loop initially goes backwards because after going forward in the for loop, the car must go back once and then to neutral as a break before it can actually go backwards.
