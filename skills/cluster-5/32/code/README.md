# udp_client_encoder

 multiple different pieces codes brought over from things in this file but the code of focus is on line 718-917

 The first function receives the value of the count to add the total distance, by updating it each time. The other function contains a while loop that checks the encoder voltage and when it changes from low to high or high to low it, it increases the count of the number of changes of this color that it saw. Therefore plugging this into the formula will be able to calculate distances and speed, as speed is simply distance over time.
