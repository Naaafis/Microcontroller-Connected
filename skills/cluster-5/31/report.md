## Summary
The Lidar lite skill required us to use either PWM or I2c or Uart to aquire readings from a version 3 lidar (for me). The lidar setup I had used PWM and it was activated on low pulses, where it would then output a pulse to the ESP what wuld have a duration proportional to the distance reading.
