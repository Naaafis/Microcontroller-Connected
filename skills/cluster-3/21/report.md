## Summary
Enabled remote desktop and installed motion to RPI zero. Connected camera to RPI and then edited motion configurations. I port forwarded the camera stream to external port 8081 (for webcams). These steps allowed me to just run motion start after rebooting the RPI and I was able to view my live stream from a different wifi.
